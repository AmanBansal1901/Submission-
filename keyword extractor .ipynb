so i can use a \u001b[42m\u001b[37mdictionary\u001b[0m to like if i'm doing in \u001b[42m\u001b[37mpython\u001b[0m then i can use it dictonary. if we are using \u001b[42m\u001b[37mc\u001b[0m then and c++, \u001b[42m\u001b[37mjava\u001b[0m there we doesn't have any \u001b[42m\u001b[37mdictionary\u001b[0m then \u001b[42m\u001b[37msir\u001b[0m we can ah we can use \u001b[42m\u001b[37marray\u001b[0m of \u001b[42m\u001b[37marrays\u001b[0m and then like make \u001b[42m\u001b[37mdictionary\u001b[0m with the \u001b[42m\u001b[37mhelp\u001b[0m of \u001b[42m\u001b[37marrays\u001b[0m \u001b[42m\u001b[37mokay\u001b[0m yes can we \u001b[42m\u001b[37mswitch\u001b[0m or not there?
